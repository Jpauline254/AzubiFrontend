    <!--NEW STORY-->
    <h1> The Story in The Book</h1>
    <h2> Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying
        between the copies of <i>Nature</i>,<i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other <br>
        scientific jouranls her work had appeared in, was well thumbed copy of <cite> On
        The road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer
        she <br>spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    </p>
    <p> She had spent the last 10 years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar
        Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have <br> 
        nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the 
        secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid"> DNA </abbr>, to be an outstanding
         achievement,Molly <br> <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
